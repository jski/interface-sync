Save All Linen Cloth You Find
|tip As you quest in Elwynn Forest, save all Linen Cloth you find.
|tip Be careful not to accidentally sell them to a vendor.
|tip You will need ~70 Linen Cloth when you are level 10-11.
|tip You will use them to create your wand, which will be a powerful weapon for you.
|tip However, if you are confident you will be able to buy a wand from the Auction House (if this isn't a new or populated server), you can ignore this.
