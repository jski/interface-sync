|tip They look like floating green eyes around this area.
|tip Try to do it with no other enemies around.
|tip You have to let it channel until you get the debuff.
|tip You will gain a debuff that will make enemies attack you from further away.
|tip After you absorb the eye, try to mount up and run out of the Zeth'Gor area as fast as you can, and try to stay away from enemies.
|tip They are pretty rare, so just kill enemies all around this area until you find one.
|tip It may take a while, but you will be reducing how much you need to grind in later levels.
